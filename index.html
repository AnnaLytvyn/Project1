          <p>
            Nike produces a wide range of sports equipment and apparel. Their
            first products were track running shoes. Nike Air Max is a line of
            shoes first released by Nike, Inc. in 1987. Additional product lines
            were introduced later, such as Air Huarache, which debuted in 1992.
            The most recent additions to their line are the Nike 6.0, Nike NYX,
            and Nike SB shoes, designed for skateboarding. Nike has recently
            introduced cricket shoes called Air Zoom Yorker, designed to be 30%
            lighter than their competitors'.[57] In 2008, Nike introduced the
            Air Jordan XX3, a high-performance basketball shoe designed with the
            environment in mind.

          <h2>">Nike Vaporfly</h2>
          <p>
            The Nike Vaporfly first came out in 2017 and their popularity, along
            with its performance, prompted a new series of running
            shoes.[65][66] The Vaporfly series has a new technological
            composition that has revolutionized long-distance running since
            studies have shown that these shoes can improve run times up to
            4.2%.[66] The composition of the sole contains a foamy material,
            Pebax, that Nike has altered and now calls it ZoomX (which can be
            found in other Nike products as well). Pebax foam can also be found
            in airplane insulation and is "squishier, bouncier, and lighter"
            than foams in typical running shoes.[66] In the middle of the ZoomX
            foam there is a full-length carbon fiber plate "designed to generate
            extra spring in every step".
