          <b>Achievements</b>
          <br />
          Achievements so far include a sustainable overhaul of its
          manufacturing processes, including using
          <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom" target="_blank"
            >Flyknit technology</a
          >, which produces 60 percent less waste than traditional cut-and-sew
          methods. Since 2012, the technology has reduced nearly 3.5 million
          pounds of waste. In addition, Nike has been using plastic bottles to
          convert into recycled polysetser and, since 2010, more than three
          billion bottles have been diverted from landfills. The companyâ€™s
          ColorDry technology, which dyes fabric using zero water, has saved
          more than 20 million litres of water.

          <b>Our goals </b>
          <br />
          Its new 2025 targets include seeing women in 45 percent and racial
          minorities in 35 percent of leadership roles, reducing greenhouse gas
          emissions by 70 percent in Nike-owned facilities and multiplying the
          amount of product waste recycled or donated, among other goals.
